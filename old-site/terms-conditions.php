        At The Pulp House Publishing, client satisfaction is our top priority. We offer refunds on a case-by-case basis
        depending on the stage of the project.
        <ul>
            <li>Full refund if work has not started.</li>
            <li>Partial refund if some deliverables have been completed.</li>
            <li>Non-refundable portions may apply to services rendered or third-party costs (ISBNs, distribution fees,
                cover art
                licensing, etc.).</li>
            <li>We work closely with every author to resolve concerns promptly and reach a fair, mutually agreeable
                outcome.</li>
            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
                <strong>Ghostwriting:</strong>
                If the final draft does not meet your expectations after three rounds of edits, you can request a
                refund, minus costs for work completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
                <strong>Publishing services: </strong>
                Once your book is printed or available for sale, refunds are not possible. If we make a major mistake,
                we will fix it at no cost.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="h2">7. Revision Policy</span>
        <p>Need changes to our work? You have 5 to 10 days after receiving the draft or final product to request edits
            for free. </p>
        <p>Every project includes a specific number of revisions depending on the service tier.
            Revisions must be based on the original scope of work and may not include new content, structural changes,
            or add-on services. Additional revisions can be purchased if needed.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
                <strong>Ghostwriting: Services: </strong>
                For ghostwriting, your contract will list the number of included revisions. Extra changes after this
                period might come with a small fee, depending on the work involved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i>
                <strong>Other Services: </strong>
                Your request for revision of marketing and publishing services is done case by case. Depends on the
